== Installation

To use the plugin, you must have the grails-schwartz plugin already installed in your project.

=== "`Install`" the plugin by adding it to build.gradle

Add a dependency for the plugin by adding it to the `dependencies` block in build.gradle:

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
dependencies {
   ...
   compile 'org.grails.plugins:schwartz-monitor:{project-version}'
   ...
}
----

=== URL Mapping controller
The plugin does not provide a default URL-Mapping for the plugins QuartzController, so you are free to map it as you like.
For this, you must add a url mapping to your URLMappings.groovy file:

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes]
----
"/quartz/$action?"(controller:"quartz")
----

=== Securing the Controller

If you use a security plugin (Spring-Security-Core, etc), you must ensure the controller methods are secured. E.g. when using Spring-Security-Core, add a rule which is appropriate for your security needs:

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
[pattern:'/quartz/**',              access:['ROLE_ADMIN']]
----
