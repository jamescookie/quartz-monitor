This plugin was initially based on the quartz-monitor plugin, but have changed during implementation in significant areas.

The Quartz-Monitor plugin uses its own quartzJobFactory, 'QuartzMonitorJobFactory',
which is a subclass of the underlying quartz plugins' GrailsJobFactory.
This can lead to several problems, e.g. if your application needs to subclass the QuartzJobFactory.
