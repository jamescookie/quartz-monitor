=== Plugin config options

There are several configuration settings that you can set in the Grails config to customize various aspects of the plugin, and you can also specify Quartz configuration settings that will affect the configuration of the Scheduler, JobStore, etc.

All config options must be in the `quartz` block in `application.groovy` (or make the equivalent changes in `application.yml` if you haven't converted it to Groovy syntax yet) but are shown here without the prefix.
